VOICE INPUT EXAMPLES
================================================================================

🎤 "switch to gmail" → Switches tab + speaks confirmation
🎤 "search for pizza recipes" → Opens search + speaks confirmation
🎤 "what's on this page?" → Analyzes + speaks answer
🎤 "compare these products" → Compares + speaks analysis
🎤 "capture this screen" → Captures + speaks confirmation

================================================================================
MULTI-TAB WORKFLOW EXAMPLES
================================================================================

1. PRODUCT COMPARISON:
   - Add 3 product tabs to session
   - Say: "compare the prices"
   - Say: "which has better reviews?"
   - Say: "which one should I buy?"

2. RESEARCH WORKFLOW:
   - Add multiple article tabs
   - Say: "summarize all tabs"
   - Say: "what are the key points?"
   - Say: "what's the common theme?"

3. SHOPPING WORKFLOW:
   - Add product tabs from different sites
   - Say: "which is the cheapest?"
   - Say: "compare shipping costs"
   - Say: "which has fastest delivery?"

================================================================================
TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
================================================================================

✓ Be specific with tab names (e.g., "switch to gmail" not "switch to mail")
✓ Use clear search queries (e.g., "search for python tutorials" not "search python")
✓ Capture screenshots before asking analysis questions
✓ Add multiple tabs to session for comparison questions
✓ Use voice input for hands-free operation
✓ Keep questions concise for faster responses
✓ Wait for first response before asking follow-up questions

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If commands don't work:
1. Make sure backend is running (http://localhost:8000)
2. Check that GEMINI_API_KEY is set in .env file
3. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions/
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Try simpler commands first

================================================================================
ADVANCED COMMANDS
================================================================================

Combining actions:
✓ "capture this and tell me what you see"
✓ "switch to youtube and capture it"
✓ "search for laptops and compare results"

Context-aware:
✓ "what's the price of this?" (after capturing product page)
✓ "compare this with the previous tab"
✓ "is this better than the other one?"
